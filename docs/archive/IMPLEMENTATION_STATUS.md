## Recent Enhancements

1. **PII Redaction Pipeline** – regex-driven sanitizer runs before storage/LLM calls; configurable via `PII_REDACTION_*` env vars and surfaced in job metadata.
2. **Structured RCA Outputs** – Markdown, HTML, JSON bundles attached to each job for UI/ticket reuse.
3. **Conversation Traceability** – Full prompt/response history persisted and accessible through `/api/conversation/{job_id}`.
4. **Watcher Events & SSE** – Streaming endpoint for watcher activity plus admin API for changing roots, include/exclude globs, and size limits.
5. **Ticket Service** – Central ticket store with dry-run support and cross-linking to job events.

## Operational Checklist

- **Environment variables**: `PII_REDACTION_*`, LLM credentials, Postgres, Redis toggles.
- **Database**: `alembic upgrade head` before first run; enables pgvector indexes.
- **Workers**: ensure at least one worker process (`python -m apps.worker.main` or container) running for background analysis.
- **Metrics**: scrape `http://api:8001/metrics`; Grafana dashboards expect standard job/ticket metrics.

## Testing & QA

| Layer            | Command/example                                             |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit tests       | `python -m pytest`                                          |
| Linting (opt-in) | `ruff check .` / `mypy` as per team standards               |
| Security         | `pip-audit`, `bandit -r core apps`                          |
| Compose smoke    | `deploy/scripts/smoke-test.sh` (ensure endpoints healthy)   |

## Backlog & Future Improvements

- **Advanced Ticketing**: push integration flows (Jira/ServiceNow API clients) with retry/backoff.
- **Watcher Runtime**: optional agent to monitor filesystem/object storage and enqueue jobs automatically.
- **Role-Based Access**: fine-grained scopes for watcher admin vs analyst roles.
- **Additional LLM Providers**: plug-ins for Anthropic native, Azure OpenAI routing, or self-hosted vLLM.
- **Analytics & Dashboards**: curated Grafana boards for SLA compliance and ticket latency.
