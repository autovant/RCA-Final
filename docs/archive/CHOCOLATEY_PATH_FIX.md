# Quick Fix: Chocolatey PATH Issue

## Problem
Chocolatey is installed at `C:\ProgramData\chocolatey` but the `choco` command isn't available in the current PowerShell session.

## Solution

**Close this PowerShell window and open a NEW PowerShell window**, then run:

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\syed.shareef\.vscode\repos\RCA - v7\RCA-Final"
.\setup-local-windows.ps1
```

## Why?
Windows adds Chocolatey to the system PATH during installation, but existing PowerShell sessions don't automatically reload environment variables. A fresh PowerShell session will have the updated PATH.

## Alternative: Manual Refresh (if you don't want to close the window)
```powershell
$env:ChocolateyInstall = Convert-Path "$((Get-Command choco -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).Source)\..\.."
Import-Module "$env:ChocolateyInstall\helpers\chocolateyProfile.psm1"
refreshenv
```

Then run:
```powershell
.\setup-local-windows.ps1
```

## What the Script Will Do
Once Chocolatey works, the script will:
1. âœ… Install PostgreSQL 15 as a Windows service
2. âœ… Install Redis for Windows
3. âœ… Create the RCA database and user
4. âœ… Run database migrations
5. âœ… Configure everything to work natively on Windows

No more Docker port forwarding issues! ðŸŽ‰
