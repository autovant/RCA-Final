## How to Use

### **For Sales/Demo Presentations:**

```
1. Open: http://localhost:3000/demo/showcase
2. Select: Demo scenario matching client's RPA platform
3. Watch: Automated analysis with live progress
4. Explain: Each feature as it's showcased
5. Navigate: Click "View Full Report" for detailed analysis
6. Reset: Try different scenario if needed
```

### **Presentation Script Template:**

**Opening:**
> "Let me show you how our RCA Engine analyzes production logs in real-time..."

**During PII Step:**
> "Notice how we automatically detect and redact 8 types of sensitive data before any AI processing. This ensures GDPR and CCPA compliance..."

**During Platform Detection:**
> "Our intelligent detection identifies this as Blue Prism version 7.2.1 with high confidence. This works across 10+ RPA platforms..."

**During Classification:**
> "Every log entry is categorized—6 errors, 8 warnings, 2 critical issues. This prioritization helps teams focus on what matters..."

**During Analysis:**
> "Finally, our AI performs root cause analysis considering all this context. Let's view the full report with actionable recommendations..."
