# ✅ System Fully Operational

## Current Status

All services are now **healthy** and responding:

```
NAMES       STATUS
rca_core    Up 41 seconds (healthy) ✅
rca_db      Up 41 seconds (healthy) ✅
rca_redis   Up 41 seconds (healthy) ✅
```

## API Endpoints Verified ✅

All previously failing endpoints are now working:

1. **GET /api/jobs/** → `[]` (empty array, ready for jobs)
2. **GET /api/tickets/demo-job?refresh=false** → `{"job_id":"demo-job","tickets":[]}`
3. **GET /api/tickets/settings/state** → `{"servicenow_enabled":false,"jira_enabled":false,"dual_mode":false}`

## What Happened

The 404 errors occurred because:
- Backend had just restarted after database table fixes
- UI loaded while backend was still initializing (health: starting)
- Backend takes ~30 seconds to reach "healthy" state

## Action Required

**Simply refresh your browser** at http://localhost:3000

The errors will disappear and you'll see:
- ✅ Live job telemetry online
- ✅ No more 404 errors
- ✅ Dashboard fully functional
