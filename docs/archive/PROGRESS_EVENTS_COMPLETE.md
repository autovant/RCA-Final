# Progress Event Implementation Complete

## ✅ User-Friendly Progress Events Added

### Event Flow for RCA Analysis

The worker now emits comprehensive progress events at each stage of analysis:

#### 1. **Classification** (Progress: 0-10%)
- **Started**: "Classifying uploaded files and preparing analysis pipeline..."
- **Completed**: "Classified X file(s) - proceeding with RCA analysis."
- **Details**: File count, file types

#### 2. **PII Redaction** (Progress: 10-40%, per file)
- **Started**: "Scanning [filename] for sensitive data..."
- **Completed**: "Masked X sensitive item(s) in [filename]." OR "No sensitive data found in [filename]."
- **Details**: File info, redaction hits, PII types found

#### 3. **Chunking** (Progress: 40-50%, per file)
- **Started**: "Segmenting [filename] into analysis chunks..."
- **Completed**: Automatic after chunks created
- **Details**: Chunk count, line count

#### 4. **Embedding Generation** (Progress: 50-60%, per file)
- **Started**: "Generating embeddings for [filename]..."
- **Completed**: Automatic after embeddings created
- **Details**: Chunk count, embedding dimensions

#### 5. **Storage** (Progress: 60-70%, per file)
- **Started**: "Storing analysis artefacts for [filename]..."
- **Completed**: Automatic after database insertion
- **Details**: Documents stored, chunks persisted

#### 6. **Correlation** (Progress: 70-75%)
- **Started**: "Searching for similar historical incidents and patterns..."
- **Completed**: "Correlation complete - analyzed patterns across X data chunks."
- **Details**: Total chunks analyzed

#### 7. **AI Analysis** (Progress: 75-90%)
- **Started**: "Running AI-powered root cause analysis using GitHub Copilot..."
- **Completed**: "AI analysis complete - identified root causes and recommendations."
- **Details**: Model name, provider, analysis duration

#### 8. **Report Generation** (Progress: 90-100%)
- **Started**: "Compiling comprehensive RCA report with findings and recommendations..."
- **Completed**: "RCA report generated successfully! Analyzed X lines across Y file(s)."
- **Details**: Total lines, errors found, warnings found, critical issues

#### 9. **Completion** (Progress: 100%)
- **Event**: "✓ Analysis complete! Root cause identified and report ready for review."
- **Details**: Total files, chunks, lines, duration

## Event Schema

Each progress event follows this structure:

```json
{
  "event_type": "analysis-progress",
  "data": {
    "step": "classification|redaction|chunking|embedding|storage|correlation|llm|report|completed",
    "status": "started|completed|failed",
    "label": "User-friendly step label",
    "message": "Detailed progress message",
    "details": {
      "progress": 0-100,
      "step": 1-8,
      "total_steps": 7,
      "file_count": 2,
      "file_number": 1,
      "total_files": 2,
      "filename": "example.log",
      ... additional context
    }
  }
}
```

## UI Integration

The frontend `StreamingChat` component listens to these events via SSE:

```typescript
// Connection established
const eventSource = new EventSource(`${apiBaseUrl}/api/jobs/${jobId}/stream`);

// Event handler
eventSource.addEventListener('job-event', (event) => {
  const payload = JSON.parse(event.data);
  if (payload.event_type === 'analysis-progress') {
    updateProgressBar(payload.data.details.progress);
    addLogEntry(payload.data.message);
    highlightCurrentStep(payload.data.step);
  }
});
```

## Testing the Events

### 1. Upload a file via UI
```
http://localhost:3000/investigation
```

### 2. Watch backend logs
The worker will emit events like:
```
[Worker] Processing job: abc-123
[Event] classification started (0%)
[Event] classification completed (10%)
[Event] redaction started for file 1/1
[Event] redaction completed - 3 PII items masked
[Event] chunking started (40%)
...
[Event] completed (100%)
```

### 3. Check job events API
```powershell
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8001/api/jobs/{job-id}/events" | 
  Select-Object event_type, @{L="Step";E={$_.data.step}}, @{L="Status";E={$_.data.status}}, @{L="Message";E={$_.data.message}} | 
  Format-Table
```

Expected output:
```
event_type        Step          Status     Message
----------        ----          ------     -------
analysis-progress classification started   Classifying uploaded files...
analysis-progress classification completed Classified 1 file(s)...
analysis-progress redaction     started    Scanning test.log for sensitive data...
analysis-progress redaction     completed  No sensitive data found in test.log
analysis-progress chunking      started    Segmenting test.log into analysis chunks...
analysis-progress embedding     started    Generating embeddings for test.log...
analysis-progress storage       started    Storing analysis artefacts for test.log...
analysis-progress correlation   started    Searching for similar historical incidents...
analysis-progress correlation   completed  Correlation complete - analyzed 5 data chunks
analysis-progress llm           started    Running AI-powered root cause analysis...
analysis-progress llm           completed  AI analysis complete - identified root causes
analysis-progress report        started    Compiling comprehensive RCA report...
analysis-progress report        completed  RCA report generated successfully! Analyzed 350 lines...
analysis-progress completed     success    ✓ Analysis complete! Root cause identified...
```

## Progress Labels

All progress steps have user-friendly labels defined in `PROGRESS_STEP_LABELS`:

```python
{
    "classification": "Classifying uploaded files",
    "redaction": "Scanning and redacting sensitive data",
    "chunking": "Segmenting content into analysis-ready chunks",
    "embedding": "Generating semantic embeddings",
    "storage": "Storing structured insights",
    "correlation": "Correlating with historical incidents",
    "llm": "Running AI-powered root cause analysis",
    "report": "Preparing final RCA report",
    "completed": "Analysis completed successfully",
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Restart the worker** to load the new progress event code
2. **Upload a test file** via the UI
3. **Watch the progress events** stream in real-time
4. **Verify UI updates** reflect each stage of processing

---

**File Modified**: `core/jobs/processor.py`  
**Events Added**: 9 progress stages with ~20+ detailed event emissions  
**Progress Tracking**: 0% → 100% with granular updates  
**User Experience**: Real-time visibility into every analysis stage
