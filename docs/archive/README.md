# Documentation Archive

Legacy notes, fix logs, and historical reports have been relocated here to declutter the active documentation set. Nothing has been deleted—refer back to these files whenever you need a paper trail of past incidents or investigations.

## Categories

- **Fix Logs & Incident Write-ups** – Files containing "FIX", "RESOLVED", "SUMMARY", or dated notes (e.g. `BACKEND_ROUTING_RESOLVED.md`, `FIX_PORT_FORWARDING_NOW.md`).
- **Legacy Setup Guides** – Superseded instructions such as `DEV_SETUP_SIMPLIFIED.md`, `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, and `RUN_UI_IN_WINDOWS.md`.
- **Operational Diaries** – Implementation status updates, optimization summaries, and end-to-end test reports.
- **Platform Experiments** – Documents covering specific environment attempts (WSL networking, hybrid startup flows, firewall workarounds).

The latest, maintained documentation now lives in:

- `docs/index.md` – entry point
- `docs/getting-started/` – quickstart & dev setup
- `docs/deployment/` – deployment guide
- `docs/operations/` – scripts and troubleshooting
- `docs/reference/` – features and architecture

If you find a document here that should be maintained going forward, move it back into the appropriate section, update the content, and link it from `docs/index.md`.
