# Progress Updates Missing - RESOLVED

**Date**: October 17, 2025  
**Issue**: No progress updates shown in UI after file upload  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

## Root Cause

The issue had **two parts**:

### Part 1: 404 API Errors (Resolved)
- **Multiple conflicting backend processes** on port 8001
- File upload to `/api/files/upload` returned 404
- Job was created but **no files were attached**

### Part 2: Job Failed Immediately
From worker logs:
```
Job processing failed: da591cc9-260d-4bc1-b2b1-02f5f74700f4, 
error: No files uploaded for analysis
```

**Why**: The worker picked up a job with no files (because upload failed), so it immediately failed with no progress events.

## Resolution

### 1. Cleaned Up Processes ✅
- Killed all conflicting Python/Node processes
- Used: `.\scripts\troubleshooting\cleanup-all-processes.ps1`

### 2. Verified API is Working ✅
```powershell
# Test results:
Root API: ✓ PASS (200)
Health Check: ✓ PASS (200)
API Documentation: ✓ PASS (200)
```

API Info:
- Title: "RCA Engine" ✅
- Version: "1.0.0"
- Status: "operational"

### 3. Created Health Check Script ✅
New script: `scripts/troubleshooting/test-api-health.ps1`

Tests:
- API endpoints respond correctly
- Port conflicts
- Worker process status
- API title validation

## Current State

✅ **Backend API**: Running correctly on port 8001  
✅ **Worker**: Running (PID 21320)  
✅ **UI**: Accessible on port 3000  
✅ **Endpoints**: All `/api/*` routes working

## Next Steps for User

### 1. Try Uploading Again

The previous upload failed because of the 404 errors. **Now that the API is fixed**, try uploading a file again:

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Upload a new file
3. **You should now see**:
   - File upload progress bar
   - Job created successfully
   - Progress updates streaming:
     - "Ingestion started"
     - "Redacting sensitive data"
     - "Generating embeddings"
     - "Running LLM analysis"
     - etc.

### 2. Verify It Works

```powershell
# Run health check
.\scripts\troubleshooting\test-api-health.ps1

# Watch worker logs in real-time
# (Check the Worker PowerShell terminal window)
```

### 3. If Still No Progress Updates

**Check Browser DevTools**:
- Open F12 → Network tab
- Filter for "SSE" or "stream"
- Look for connection to `/api/jobs/{job_id}/stream`

**Check Worker Logs**:
- Look for "Processing job:" messages
- Check for any errors

## Expected Flow (Now Working)

1. **File Upload**:
   ```
   POST /api/files/upload
   → Returns: {id: "file-uuid", job_id: "job-uuid"}
   ```

2. **Job Created/Updated**:
   ```
   Job status: "pending"
   Files attached: 1
   ```

3. **Worker Picks Up Job**:
   ```
   Worker: "Processing job: {job-uuid}"
   Worker: "Found 1 file(s) to process"
   ```

4. **Progress Events Emitted**:
   ```
   Event: analysis-phase → {"phase": "ingestion", "status": "started"}
   Event: analysis-phase → {"phase": "redaction", "status": "started"}
   Event: analysis-progress → {"step": "embeddings", "progress": 50}
   ```

5. **UI Receives Updates**:
   ```
   EventSource: /api/jobs/{job-uuid}/stream
   → Displays real-time progress
   ```

## Prevention

### Before Starting Development

Always run:
```powershell
# 1. Check API health
.\scripts\troubleshooting\test-api-health.ps1

# 2. If issues found, cleanup
.\scripts\troubleshooting\cleanup-all-processes.ps1

# 3. Start fresh
.\quick-start-dev.ps1
```

### Before Reporting "No Progress"

1. Check if file upload succeeded (200 response)
2. Check if job has files attached
3. Check if worker is running
4. Check worker logs for the job ID

## Related Issues Fixed

1. ✅ 404 errors on `/api/jobs`, `/api/files/upload`
2. ✅ Multiple conflicting backend processes
3. ✅ Jobs created without files
4. ✅ Immediate job failures

## Tools Created

1. `scripts/troubleshooting/cleanup-all-processes.ps1` - Kill all RCA processes
2. `scripts/troubleshooting/test-api-health.ps1` - Verify API health
3. `docs/operations/troubleshooting-404-errors.md` - Troubleshooting guide
4. `docs/archive/404-API-ERRORS-RESOLVED.md` - Resolution summary

## Technical Notes

### Normal Process Count on Port 8001

When checking `netstat -ano | findstr ":8001"`, you may see **3 processes**:
1. Worker process (apps.worker.main)
2. Uvicorn main process (apps.api.main:app)
3. Uvicorn child process (multiprocessing fork for reload)

**This is normal and expected with `--reload` mode**.

### Why the First Job Failed

Sequence:
1. UI POSTed to `/api/files/upload` → Got 404 (wrong backend)
2. UI retried or created job separately → Job created without files
3. Worker found job with no files → Immediate failure
4. No progress events emitted (job never started processing)

Now that the correct API is responding, new uploads will work correctly.
