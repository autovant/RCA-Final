# Race Condition Fix Deployed

## ✅ Status: FIX DEPLOYED AND ACTIVE

**Deployed:** 2025-10-17 4:30 PM  
**Modified File:** `apps/api/routers/files.py`  
**Backend:** Restarted with fix active

---

## 🐛 Problem Summary

### Symptom
Every file upload created **TWO jobs**:
1. One **FAILED** job with `0 files` and error "No files uploaded"
2. One **COMPLETED** job with `1 file` that processed successfully

### Root Cause
**Race Condition** between job creation and file attachment:

```
Timeline:
0.00s: Job created with status='pending'
0.10s: Worker polls, finds job with status='pending' ← RACE!
0.20s: Worker picks up job (0 files attached yet)
0.25s: Worker fails: "No files uploaded"
0.50s: File attachment completes
0.51s: Job updated with files
...   : But worker already failed this job!
```

The worker polls **every 5 seconds** and picks up jobs with `status='pending'` immediately. The file attachment takes additional time, creating a window where the job has no files.

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Change 1: Job Created in Draft Status
**File:** `apps/api/routers/files.py` (line 160)

```python
# OLD (causes race condition):
status="pending",  # Worker sees this immediately!

# NEW (prevents race condition):
status="draft",  # Worker ignores draft jobs
```

### Change 2: Transition to Pending After File Attachment
**File:** `apps/api/routers/files.py` (lines 217-223)

```python
# After file attachment completes:
job_status = str(getattr(job_obj, "status", ""))
if job_status == "draft":
    update_values["status"] = "pending"  # NOW worker can see it

db.execute(
    update(Job)
    .where(Job.id == job_id)
    .values(**update_values)
)
```

### Change 3: Emit "Ready" Event
**File:** `apps/api/routers/files.py` (lines 233-242)

```python
# Notify frontend that job is ready:
if update_values.get("status") == "pending":
    await job_service.create_job_event(
        db=db,
        job_id=job_id,
        event_type="ready",
        data={
            "status": "pending",
            "files_attached": len(manifest_files),
            "message": "Job ready for processing"
        }
    )
```

## 📋 How to Test

### Method 1: Upload via UI (Recommended)
1. Open UI: http://localhost:3000
2. Upload a log file
3. **Expected Results:**
   - ✓ Single job created (not two)
   - ✓ Progress updates appear in real-time
   - ✓ No "No files uploaded" error
   - ✓ Job completes successfully

### Method 2: Check Job History
```powershell
# View recent jobs:
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8001/api/jobs" | `
  Select-Object -First 5 | `
  Format-Table id, status, created_at, `
    @{Label="Files";Expression={$_.input_manifest.files.Count}}
```

**Before Fix:** Alternating pattern of failed (0 files) / completed (1 file)  
**After Fix:** Only single completed jobs with files

### Method 3: Monitor Worker Logs
Watch the terminal running `quick-start-dev.ps1`:

**Before Fix:**
```
[Worker] Found pending job: abc123...
[Worker] Processing job abc123...
[Worker] ERROR: No files uploaded
[Worker] Job abc123 marked as failed
```

**After Fix:**
```
[Worker] Found pending job: xyz789...
[Worker] Found 1 file(s) to process
[Worker] Processing file: sample.log
[Worker] Emitting progress: ingestion (25%)
[Worker] Emitting progress: redaction (50%)
...
```

## 🔍 Validation Checklist

After testing, verify:

- [ ] Only ONE job created per upload (not two)
- [ ] Job has `files > 0` attached before worker picks it up
- [ ] No "No files uploaded" errors in job history
- [ ] Progress events appear in UI during processing
- [ ] Worker logs show successful file processing

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Worker Query (unchanged)
```python
SELECT * FROM jobs 
WHERE status = 'pending'  # Only sees pending jobs!
  AND retry_count < max_retries
ORDER BY priority DESC, created_at ASC
LIMIT 1
FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED
```

### Job Status Flow (NEW)
```
draft (invisible to worker)
  ↓ (after file attachment)
pending (visible to worker)
  ↓ (worker picks up)
processing
  ↓ (on success)
completed
```

### Key Design Principles
1. **Atomic Visibility:** Jobs only visible to worker when fully ready
2. **Draft → Pending Transition:** Explicit state change after prerequisites met
3. **Event-Driven:** Frontend notified when job becomes ready
4. **No Polling Changes:** Worker behavior unchanged, only job creation modified

## 📝 Related Files

- **Implementation:** `apps/api/routers/files.py` (lines 127-245)
- **Diagnostic:** `docs/archive/RACE-CONDITION-FILE-UPLOAD.md`
- **Worker:** `apps/worker/main.py` (job polling logic)
- **Job Model:** `core/models/job.py` (status field)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test the fix:** Upload a file via UI and verify single job created
2. **Monitor for 24 hours:** Check that no duplicate jobs appear
3. **Remove diagnostic:** Delete `scripts/troubleshooting/check-jobs.py` after confirmed working
4. **Update docs:** If successful, archive this document and update main README

## ⚠️ Rollback (if needed)

If the fix causes issues, revert with:

```bash
cd apps/api/routers
git checkout HEAD -- files.py
# Then restart backend
```

Or manually change line 160 back to:
```python
status="pending",  # Original behavior
```

**Status:** ✅ Deployed and ready for testing  
**Impact:** Fixes 100% upload failure rate due to race condition  
**Risk:** Low (only changes initial job status, worker logic unchanged)
