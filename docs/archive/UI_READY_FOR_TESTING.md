## How to Test End-to-End

### 1. Open the Investigation Page
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000/investigation**

You should see:
- **Upload Files** section (Step 1)
- **Configure Analysis** section (Step 2)  
- **Live Analysis Stream** section (Step 3)
  - 9 progress steps displayed (all gray circles - pending)
  - Status: "Ready"
  - Connection: "Offline" (until file uploaded)

### 2. Upload a Test File

1. Click **"Upload files for analysis"** button
2. Select `test-error.log` (353 bytes)
3. File appears in **"Uploaded Files (1)"** list
4. **"Start Analysis"** button becomes enabled

### 3. Start the Analysis

1. Click **"Start Analysis"** button
2. Watch the magic happen! 🚀

### 4. Observe Real-Time Progress

Within seconds you should see:

#### Header Updates:
- **Status Badge**: "Ready" → "Queued" → "Running" → "Completed"
- **Live Indicator**: Changes from "Offline" (gray) to "Live" (pulsing green)
- **Progress Bar**: Appears and fills from 0% → 10% → 70% → 75% → 90% → 100%
- **Percentage Display**: Shows current progress (e.g., "75%")

#### Step-by-Step Progress (9 steps):
Each step changes from gray circle → blue pulsing → green checkmark:

1. ⚪→🔵→✅ **Classifying uploaded files** (0-10%)
   - "Classifying uploaded files and preparing analysis pipeline..."
   - "Classified 1 file - proceeding with RCA analysis."

2. ⚪→🔵→✅ **Scanning and redacting sensitive data** (10-40%)
   - "Scanning test-error.log (1/1) for sensitive data..."

4. ⚪→🔵→✅ **Generating semantic embeddings** (50-60%)
   - "Generating embeddings for test-error.log (1/1)..."
   - "Generated embeddings for 1 segment from test-error.log (1/1)."

5. ⚪→🔵→✅ **Storing structured insights** (60-70%)
   - "Storing analysis artefacts for test-error.log (1/1)..."
   - "Stored 1 document for test-error.log (1/1)."

6. ⚪→🔵→✅ **Correlating with historical incidents** (70-75%)
   - "Searching for similar historical incidents and patterns..."
   - "Correlation complete - analyzed patterns across 1 data chunks."

7. ⚪→🔵→✅ **Running AI-powered root cause analysis** (75-90%)
   - "Running AI-powered root cause analysis using GitHub Copilot..."

8. ⚪→🔵→✅ **Preparing final RCA report** (90-100%)
   - "Compiling comprehensive RCA report with findings and recommendations..."
   - "RCA report generated successfully! Analyzed 5 lines across 1 file(s)."

9. ⚪→🔵→✅ **Analysis completed successfully** (100%)
   - "✓ Analysis complete! Root cause identified and report ready for review."

#### Activity Log:
Scrolling log with colored timeline:
- 🟦 Blue dots: Info messages
- 🟩 Green dots: Success messages
- 🟨 Yellow dots: Warnings
- 🟥 Red dots: Errors

Each entry shows:
- Message text

**Total Duration**: ~8-10 seconds

## Technical Details

### SSE Connection
- **Endpoint**: `GET /api/jobs/{jobId}/stream`
- **Protocol**: Server-Sent Events (EventSource)
- **Event Types**: 
  - `job-event` - Progress updates
  - `heartbeat` - Keep-alive

### Event Structure
```typescript
{
  event_type: "analysis-progress",
  data: {
    step: "classification|redaction|chunking|...",
    status: "started|completed|failed",
    label: "User-friendly step name",
    message: "Detailed progress message",
    details: {
      progress: 0-100,        // Overall percentage
      step: 1-9,              // Current step number
      total_steps: 9,         // Total steps
      file_count: 1,          // Files processed
      // ... other metadata
    }
  },
  created_at: "2025-10-17T21:08:34Z"
}
```

### UI State Flow
```
1. User uploads file
   ↓
2. File upload POST /api/files/upload
   ↓
3. Job created with status='draft'
   ↓
4. Files attached, status → 'pending'
   ↓
5. EventSource connects to /api/jobs/{id}/stream
   ↓
6. Worker picks up job (status → 'running')
   ↓
7. Progress events stream via SSE
   ↓
8. UI updates in real-time:
   - Progress bar animates
   - Step status changes
   - Activity log populates
   ↓
9. Job completes (status → 'completed')
   ↓
10. Final "✓ Analysis complete!" message
```

## Troubleshooting

### Progress Not Updating
**Symptom**: Steps stay gray, no events in activity log  
**Check**:
1. Worker is running: `Get-Process python`
2. Backend logs show worker polling
3. Browser DevTools → Network → `/stream` connection active
4. No JavaScript console errors

**Fix**: Restart worker if stopped

### Connection Shows "Offline"
**Symptom**: Red "Offline" indicator, no live dot  
**Check**:
1. Backend running on port 8001
2. Job ID exists in database
3. SSE endpoint responding: Check Network tab

**Fix**: Restart backend: `python -m uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload --port 8001`

### Progress Bar Stuck
**Symptom**: Bar stops at certain percentage  
**Check**:
1. Worker logs for errors
2. Backend logs for exceptions
3. Event details have `progress` field

**Fix**: Check worker terminal for Python errors

### Steps Skip or Jump
**Symptom**: Steps go from pending straight to completed  
**Cause**: Missing "started" events or rapid processing  
**Expected**: Small files process quickly, steps may appear instant  
**Normal**: This is fine! The backend emits both started/completed events.

3. 🐛 **Fix any issues** - If events don't show, check logs

### Future Enhancements
1. Add error recovery UI (retry failed jobs)
2. Show ETA/remaining time estimates
3. Add pause/cancel job buttons
4. Support multi-file uploads with parallel progress
5. Add file preview in activity log
6. Export activity log to file

- ✅ Frontend UI serving http://localhost:3000
- ✅ Worker polling for jobs every 5 seconds
- ✅ Database tables created and migrated
- ✅ Progress events implemented and tested (backend)
- ✅ UI event handlers updated and ready

**Next Action**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000/investigation and upload `test-error.log`!

## Contact

If you encounter any issues during testing, check:
1. Backend terminal for API errors
2. Worker terminal for processing errors
3. Frontend terminal for Next.js errors
4. Browser console (F12) for JavaScript errors
5. Network tab for SSE connection status

All logs use structured JSON format for easy debugging.

**Happy Testing!** 🚀✨
