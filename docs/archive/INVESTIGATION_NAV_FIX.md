# Investigation Page Navigation Fix

## Issue
The investigation page (`/investigation`) was missing the main navigation header component, preventing users from navigating to other parts of the application once they were on that page.

## Fix Applied

### File Modified
**`ui/src/app/investigation/page.tsx`**

### Changes Made

1. **Added Header Import**
   ```typescript
   import { Header } from "@/components/layout/Header";
   ```

2. **Added Header Component**
   - Inserted the `<Header>` component at the top of the page layout
   - Position: Before the page-specific header section
   - Props: `title="RCA Investigation"` and `subtitle="Root Cause Analysis"`

### Code Structure
```tsx
return (
  <div className="min-h-screen bg-dark-bg-primary">
    {/* Navigation Header - NEW */}
    <Header title="RCA Investigation" subtitle="Root Cause Analysis" />
    
    {/* Page Header - Existing */}
    <div className="border-b border-dark-border bg-dark-bg-secondary">
      <div className="container mx-auto px-6 py-6">
        <div className="flex items-center gap-3">
          {/* Page-specific icon and title */}
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    {/* Main Content */}
    <div className="container mx-auto px-6 py-8">
      {/* Investigation form and streaming chat */}
    </div>
  </div>
);
```

## Result

✅ **Navigation Restored**
- Users can now access all navigation links from the investigation page
- Header includes links to:
  - Dashboard (/)
  - Investigate (/investigation)
  - Related (/related)
  - Features (/features) - NEW
  - About (/about)
  - Jobs (/jobs)
  - Tickets (/tickets)
  - Docs (/docs)

✅ **Consistent UX**
- Investigation page now matches the navigation pattern of other pages
- Users won't get trapped on the investigation page
- Maintains visual consistency across the application

## Other Pages Verified

All other pages already have the Header component:
- ✅ `/` (Homepage) - Has Header
- ✅ `/related` - Has Header
- ✅ `/features` - Has Header (newly added)
- ✅ `/about` - Has Header
- ✅ `/jobs` - Has Header
- ✅ `/tickets` - Has Header

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Start the development server:
   ```powershell
   cd ui
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/investigation

3. Verify:
   - Navigation header is visible at the top
