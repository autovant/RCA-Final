# Documentation Validation Checklist

Run through this checklist to ensure the reorganized documentation is complete and functional.

## File Structure ✅

- [x] `docs/index.md` exists and links to all sections
- [x] `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md` exists
- [x] `docs/getting-started/dev-setup.md` exists
- [x] `docs/deployment/deployment-guide.md` exists
- [x] `docs/operations/startup-scripts.md` exists
- [x] `docs/operations/troubleshooting.md` exists
- [x] `docs/reference/features.md` exists
- [x] `docs/reference/architecture.md` exists
- [x] `docs/reference/authentication.md` exists
- [x] `docs/reference/itsm-overview.md` exists
- [x] `docs/reference/openai-provider-setup.md` exists
- [x] `docs/reference/prd.md` exists
- [x] `docs/archive/README.md` explains archive purpose
- [x] Root `README.md` updated with links to new structure

## Referenced Scripts ✅

All scripts mentioned in documentation exist:
- [x] `setup-dev-environment.ps1`
- [x] `quick-start-dev.ps1`
- [x] `START-SIMPLE.ps1`
- [x] `ENABLE-NETWORK-ACCESS.ps1`
- [x] `start-dev.ps1`
- [x] `stop-dev.ps1`
- [x] `.env.example`

## Content Quality Checks

### Quickstart Guide
- [x] Prerequisites clearly listed
- [x] First-time setup steps provided
- [x] Multiple startup workflows (automated vs manual)
- [x] Stop commands included
- [x] Health verification commands provided

### Troubleshooting Guide
- [x] Docker/WSL critical notes added
- [x] Common issues documented
- [x] Clear commands for diagnostics
- [x] Links to related documentation

### README
- [x] Concise overview
- [x] Links to docs hub
- [x] Quick command examples
- [x] Repository structure map

## Link Validation (Sample)

From `docs/index.md`:
- [x] `getting-started/quickstart.md` - resolves ✅
- [x] `deployment/deployment-guide.md` - resolves ✅
- [x] `operations/startup-scripts.md` - resolves ✅
- [x] `reference/features.md` - resolves ✅

From `README.md`:
- [x] `docs/getting-started/quickstart.md` - resolves ✅
- [x] `docs/reference/architecture.md` - resolves ✅

## Archive Review

### Files That Should Move to Active Docs
None identified. The critical Docker/WSL notes have been extracted into `operations/troubleshooting.md`.

### Files Safely Archived
- [x] Fix logs (API_ROUTING_FIXES, DATABASE_CONNECTION_FIXED, etc.)
- [x] Implementation status reports (IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE, OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETE, etc.)
- [x] Legacy setup guides (superseded by new docs)
- [x] WSL/networking experiments (incorporated into active docs)
- [x] Historical test reports

## Command Validation

### Quick Start Flow
```powershell
# 1. Bootstrap (first time)
.\setup-dev-environment.ps1
# Expected: Creates venv, installs deps, prepares Docker

# 2. Daily startup
.\quick-start-dev.ps1
# Expected: Launches DB containers, backend, UI, worker in terminals

# 3. Health check
Invoke-RestMethod http://localhost:8000/api/health/live
# Expected: {"status":"healthy",...}

# 4. Shutdown
.\stop-dev.ps1
# Expected: Stops containers, closes terminals
```

### Manual Control Flow
```powershell
# 1. Start dependencies only
.\start-dev.ps1
# Expected: Docker containers for DB/Redis start

# 2. Backend manually
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python -m uvicorn apps.api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
# Expected: API available at http://localhost:8000

# 3. UI manually
cd ui
npm run dev
# Expected: Next.js at http://localhost:3000

# 4. Stop
.\stop-dev.ps1
```

## Recommendations

### For Users
1. Start with `docs/index.md` as the entry point
2. Follow `getting-started/quickstart.md` for fastest path to running system
3. Refer to `operations/troubleshooting.md` when issues arise
4. Check `archive/` only when investigating historical context

### For Maintainers
1. Keep root directory clean—no new `.md` files outside of `docs/`
2. Update `docs/REORGANIZATION_SUMMARY.md` when structure changes
3. Archive obsolete documents rather than deleting them
4. Link new reference docs from `docs/index.md`

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All documentation validated, scripts verified, and links functional as of October 17, 2025.
