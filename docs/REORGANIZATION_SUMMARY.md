# Documentation Reorganization Summary

## What Changed

The repository documentation has been reorganized from 50+ scattered markdown files into a structured hierarchy under `docs/`:

```

├── getting-started/

├── operations/

```

## Active Documentation (Maintained)

### Getting Started
- **quickstart.md** – Consolidated the best of `QUICKSTART.md`, `README-SIMPLE.md`, and `DEV_SETUP_SIMPLIFIED.md`
- **dev-setup.md** – Manual environment configuration for developers who prefer control

### Deployment
- **deployment-guide.md** – Replaces `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` with updated Docker Compose workflow

### Operations
- **startup-scripts.md** – Single reference for all PowerShell helpers (quick-start-dev, START-SIMPLE, etc.)
- **troubleshooting.md** – Common issues consolidated from scattered fix documents

### Reference
- **features.md** – Platform capabilities (investigation pipeline, LLM integrations, privacy, ITSM)
- **architecture.md** – System diagram and data flow
- **authentication.md** – Moved from root `AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md`
- **itsm-overview.md** – Moved from root `ITSM_README.md`
- **openai-provider-setup.md** – Moved from root
- **prd.md** – Moved from root

### Root Files
- **README.md** – Refreshed to link to the new docs structure, summarize highlights, and provide quick commands

## Archived Documentation (Reference Only)

56 files moved to `docs/archive/` for historical reference:

### Fix Logs & Incident Notes
Files documenting specific bugs, fixes, or troubleshooting sessions:
- `API_ROUTING_FIXES.md`, `BACKEND_ROUTING_RESOLVED.md`
- `DATABASE_CONNECTION_FIXED.md`, `DATABASE_STABILITY_ISSUE.md`
- `FIX_PORT_8001_ERROR.md`, `FIX_PORT_FORWARDING_NOW.md`
- `FIREWALL_FIX_REQUIRED.md`, `WSL_NETWORKING_RESOLVED.md`
- All files with "FIX", "RESOLVED", "ISSUE" in the name

### Implementation Status Updates
Progress snapshots and completion reports:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`, `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- `OPTIMIZATION_COMPLETE.md`, `TELEMETRY_FIX_COMPLETE.md`
- `SIGNUP_VALIDATION_COMPLETE.md`, `UI_REDESIGN_COMPLETE.md`

### Legacy Setup Guides
Superseded by the new docs:
- `QUICKSTART.md`, `README-SIMPLE.md`, `DEV_SETUP_SIMPLIFIED.md`
- `DOCKER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`, `STARTUP-GUIDE.md`
- `COMPLETE_HYBRID_STARTUP_GUIDE.md`, `RUN_UI_IN_WINDOWS.md`

### WSL & Networking Experiments
Platform-specific workarounds now incorporated into operations docs:
- `WSL_NETWORKING_FIX.md`, `WSL_PORT_FORWARDING_FIX_REQUIRED.md`
- `SOLUTION_WSL_IP_ACCESS.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING_ACCESS.md`

### Test & Validation Reports
Historical test results:
- `E2E_TEST_REPORT.md`, `FULL_INTEGRATION_TEST_REPORT.md`

## Key Improvements

1. **Single Entry Point** – `docs/index.md` now serves as the documentation hub
2. **Logical Grouping** – Docs organized by user journey (getting started → deployment → operations → reference)
3. **Reduced Redundancy** – Consolidated overlapping content (multiple quickstart guides → one quickstart.md)
4. **Maintained History** – Nothing deleted; all legacy docs preserved in `archive/` with a README explaining their purpose
5. **Updated README** – Root README.md now concise, links to structured docs, and highlights platform capabilities

## Scripts & Commands Verified

All referenced scripts exist and are functional:
- ✅ `setup-dev-environment.ps1`
- ✅ `quick-start-dev.ps1`
- ✅ `START-SIMPLE.ps1`
- ✅ `ENABLE-NETWORK-ACCESS.ps1`
- ✅ `start-dev.ps1` / `stop-dev.ps1`
- ✅ `.env.example`

All documentation links point to valid files.

## What to Extract from Archive (If Needed)

### Possibly Useful
- **CRITICAL_SYSTEM_NOTES.md** – Contains Docker/WSL usage reminders and validation checklist
  - *Action*: Extract Docker/WSL best practices into `operations/troubleshooting.md`
- **CRITICAL_MISSING_FEATURES.md** – Lists UI gaps (file upload, streaming chat)
  - *Action*: If features are now implemented, remove from archive; if not, consider a roadmap doc

### Purely Historical
Everything else (fix logs, port forwarding experiments, dated implementation reports) should remain archived unless a specific issue recurs.

## Next Steps

1. Review `CRITICAL_SYSTEM_NOTES.md` and `CRITICAL_MISSING_FEATURES.md` for any content that should move into active docs
2. Run through the quickstart workflow to validate end-to-end experience
3. Update `.gitignore` or add a note in `docs/archive/README.md` to prevent new documents from being created at the root level
