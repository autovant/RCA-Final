# RCA Insight Engine

Unified, Python-first root-cause analysis platform with multi-provider LLM support, streaming progress updates, and ITSM integrations.

## üîí Enterprise-Grade PII Protection

**Your data security is our top priority.** The RCA Engine implements comprehensive, **multi-layered PII redaction** to ensure no sensitive information reaches LLMs or analysis outputs:

- ‚úÖ **30+ Pattern Types**: Automatically detects AWS/Azure keys, JWT tokens, passwords, emails, SSNs, credit cards, private keys, database credentials, and more
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Pass Scanning**: Runs up to 3 redaction passes to catch nested or revealed patterns
- ‚úÖ **Strict Validation**: Post-redaction validation detects potential leaks with security warnings
- ‚úÖ **Highly Visible**: Prominent UI indicators show real-time redaction stats and security status
- ‚úÖ **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all redactions for compliance and security audits
- ‚úÖ **Enabled by Default**: Zero configuration needed‚Äîprotection is active out of the box

**See [PII Protection Guide](docs/PII_PROTECTION_GUIDE.md) for complete security documentation.**

## Highlights

- **üîí PII Protection** ‚Äì Multi-pass redaction with strict validation protects 30+ sensitive data types before any LLM or storage operations.
- **Investigation pipeline** ‚Äì FastAPI API + async worker coordinate redaction, embeddings (pgvector), retrieval, and LLM reasoning while emitting friendly `analysis-progress` events.
- **Flexible LLM providers** ‚Äì Toggle between GitHub Copilot, OpenAI, Bedrock, Anthropic, LM Studio, or vLLM with per-job overrides.
- **ITSM ready** ‚Äì Ticket adapters for ServiceNow and Jira, structured outputs (Markdown/HTML/JSON), and optional dry-run previews.
- **Observability** ‚Äì Prometheus metrics, structured logs, and optional Grafana dashboards.
- **Next.js UI** ‚Äì Upload artefacts, monitor live progress with real-time redaction stats, and review investigation transcripts.

See the [Architecture Overview](docs/reference/architecture.md) for a component diagram and data flow summary.

## Local Development

The fastest path is the consolidated quickstart:

```powershell
.\quick-start-dev.ps1
```

This launches the database containers, backend API (with reload), Next.js UI, optional worker, and Copilot proxy in dedicated terminals. Flags such as `-IncludeWorker`, `-NoWorker`, and `-NoBrowser` control behaviour.

Prefer more control? Follow the steps outlined in the [Developer Environment Setup](docs/getting-started/dev-setup.md) guide to run services manually via `start-dev.ps1`, Uvicorn, and `npm run dev`.

---

## Testing & Quality

```powershell
.\venv\Scripts\activate
python -m pytest

# Run Playwright UI smoke tests
cd tests\playwright
npm install   # first run only
npm test
```

Add linters or type-checkers (e.g. `ruff`, `mypy`) via your preferred workflow.
